## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview
- Dazhbog is a decentralized perpetual futures exchange platform on the Hydration parachain within the Polkadot ecosystem.
- The platform allows users to trade perpetual futures contracts in a decentralized manner, leveraging the security, scalability, and interoperability of the Polkadot network. By integrating into the Hydration parachain, Dazhbog aims to provide a seamless and efficient trading experience without relying on centralized intermediaries.
- Dazhbog's core concept and technical feasibility were rigorously validated. Our project secured first place in the DeFi category at the Polkadot Prodigy hackathon (https://www.polkadotprodigy.com), a prestigious competition within the Polkadot ecosystem. Here is the link https://x.com/PolkadotProdigy/status/1800506214658494794 of the Twitter post where the winner was announced. This achievement demonstrates the extensive research conducted and the project's potential. The recognition highlights the traction Dazhbog has gained within the Polkadot community, further motivating our team to pursue its development.
- Dazhbog will be built using Substrate, ensuring it is natively compatible with the Polkadot ecosystem. The project will be deployed as a set of pallets on the Hydration parachain.
- Our team strengthened with a Polkadot Blockchain Academy 2024 graduate, is passionate about advancing the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape by creating innovative and accessible financial tools. We believe that decentralized perpetual futures exchanges are a crucial component of the DeFi ecosystem, providing users with new opportunities for trading and hedging.
- Our initial idea was to apply for the Decentralized Futures program with Dazhbog as a whole project. However, after internal consultations and analysis, we decided to proceed step by step as we started, first validating the idea at the Polkadot Prodigy hackathon, and then applying for a Level 2 grant for the Proof-of-Concept of Dazhbog.

- What your project is not or will not provide or implement. This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations that might not be obvious.<br></br>
In the PoC, Dazhbog will not implement an additional Oracle module; instead, it will use spot prices from an external service. Backend services for event monitoring will be excluded from the PoC as they are not essential. The Admin module will have basic user and admin roles for the PoC version, with plans to expand to more roles in the future. Technical documentation will include an architecture overview and platform setup instructions, but will not contain detailed tutorials or code examples.
In the production-ready version, Dazhbog will integrate with other features on the Hydration parachain, such as those for DEX, liquidity, price discovery, etc. To ensure ease of implementation and seamless operation with the Hydration parachain, Dazhbog will utilize existing, tested, and proven functionalities rather than developing its own solutions for these features.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Dazhbog fits into the Polkadot ecosystem as a decentralized financial platform specifically designed for trading perpetual futures contracts. By deploying as one or more substrate pallets on the Hydration parachain, Dazhbog enhances the DeFi landscape within Polkadot
- Our target audience includes all individuals who use DeFi, as they will find new opportunities trading on Dazhbog. This encompasses our team, who are deeply invested in using and improving the platform to meet the highest standards. Additionally, newcomers to DeFi who are eager to explore advanced financial instruments in a user-friendly and secure environment, Dazhbog aims to attract a diverse range of users, from experienced DeFi enthusiasts to those just beginning their journey in decentralized finance.
- Dazhbog addresses the growing demand for advanced financial instruments within the DeFi community.
